# tex2bmp-amsh
A simple .TEX to .BMP converter for Army Men games.

I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER!
tex2bmp is a converter I made feeding Google's Gemini AI info about what I found inside the .TEX files for Army Men Sarge's Heroes PC.
Needless to say I am shocked that Gemini was able to help me even remotely write a converter based on my findings.
It's nowhere near perfect, but it's a start for learning how .TEX files function for certain Army Men titles.

How to use:
Just drag and drop any .TEX files on top of the tex2bmp.exe and it'll spit out a .BMP ready to view. The .TEX file MUST be inside the same directory as the tex2bmp!
Not all .TEX files will work, it currently doesn't like any files with odd sizes. It also struggles with larger images with bigger color palettes.
